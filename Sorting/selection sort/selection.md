#Selection Sort
It divites the array into sorted part and unsorted part.
It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning of the sorted array.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsroted array is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
